# AdiBags

This is my forked and heavily modified version of [AdiBags](https://github.com/AdiAddons/AdiBags).

All credit for this wonderful addon goes to Adirelle.

It is intended to be used together with my AdiBags plugin/extension [AdiBags_Zigi](https://github.com/glassleo/AdiBags_Zigi). It also requires [Media_Newsom](https://github.com/glassleo/Media_Newsom) for some textures for now.

## Changes

- Column layout is now fixed-width at 8 bag slots per row
- Removed the Blizzard sort button
- Removed the close buttons for bags
- Removed the ability to hide/show individual categories
- Added a button to hide/show two special "Stuff" and "Bank Stuff" categories
- Reworked sorting heavily
- Many aesthetic changes such as new bag icons and prettier button textures, different spacing and font sizes
- Fixed the major bug where the bag layout is sometimes garbled the first time you open it
- Minor bug fixes
