    Added an option to show the levels of caged battle pets.
    
    Merges #498:
    * Refactors UpdateButton to split item logic from the display logic. This was necessary due to multiple changes over the years that have added up and the initial assumption that only items are in your bags.  Things that aren't items include Battle Pet Cages added in Mists of Pandaria and Mythic Keystones added in Legion.
